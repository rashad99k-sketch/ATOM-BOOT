# RF Liquidity Pro — Validation Report

## Scope

This package was reviewed as the executable RF Liquidity Pro codebase, not as a screenshot-only exercise.

### Canonical pipeline validated

`BingX venue discovery -> Deep Radar -> Top 60 Watchlist -> continuous rotating analysis -> Institutional Execution Queue -> persistent confirmation -> Portfolio execution`

The scanner does not place orders directly.

## Implemented hardening

### Deep Radar / Watchlist
- Dynamic venue discovery is used as the source of truth.
- Executable markets are restricted to `swap` / `future` market types.
- Asset classes are classified as CRYPTO, STOCK, INDEX, GOLD, and OIL.
- The radar scans the configured discovery universe and ranks candidates globally.
- Default watchlist target is 60.
- Watchlist analysis rotates through the active symbols continuously and evaluates BUY and SELL independently.
- A missing/zero radar limit does not collapse the result to zero.
- Radar requests enough OHLCV history for the core validators.

### Institutional Execution Queue
- Discovery cannot execute directly.
- Queue candidates are built from deep watchlist evidence.
- Queue re-evaluates order-block, zone, liquidity, institutional flow, structure, timing, trend, and risk.
- Persistent confirmation is required before READY.
- READY now additionally requires minimum institutional/structure/liquidity/order-block quality.
- Order-block quality now distinguishes causal displacement-backed zones from random wicks and broken zones.
- Weak candidates are returned/removed rather than being silently executed.

### News / Event Risk
- Instrument-specific Yahoo Finance public search is preferred.
- RSS is the fallback.
- Results are cached and age-filtered.
- Macro headlines are cached separately.
- News contributes bias/risk and can block high-risk execution.
- News cannot create an entry by itself.

### Portfolio
- Maximum concurrent capacity defaults to 6.
- Six positions are a capacity, not a mandate.
- Default sizing is 10% margin per position with a 60% aggregate portfolio cap.
- Per-asset-class exposure is capped by configuration.
- Existing trade-management/execution logic remains the final authority.

### Windows reliability
- The project starts in PAPER mode by default when the environment variable is absent.
- `run_windows.bat` creates the virtual environment and `.env` from the safe example.
- Dependency installation occurs only when required imports are missing.
- Source verification runs before the test suite.
- The bot is not started when structural tests fail.

## Automated validation

Executed in the build environment:

- `python verify_project.py` — PASS
- `python -m pytest -q` — **27 passed, 1 skipped**
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v` — **28 tests OK, 1 dependency-only skip**
- Python AST parsing / bytecode compilation — PASS
- Deep Radar zero-regression tests — PASS
- Provider-failure watchlist preservation — PASS
- Optional `RADAR_SYMBOLS` filter — PASS
- Dynamic Watchlist seed tests — PASS
- Multi-asset universe tests — PASS
- News provider/fallback tests — PASS
- Portfolio isolation/capacity tests — PASS
- Fake-vs-causal Order Block tests — PASS
- Institutional READY gate tests — PASS
- Paper-mode safety regression — PASS

## External engineering research

The implementation was compared against public Vibe-Trading/Vibe Trade architecture patterns. Useful principles were adopted at the architecture level: bounded market-data providers, heartbeat/trigger separation, evidence-gated actions, explicit permission/approval boundaries, persistent state, and auditable decision records. The RF execution kernel was not replaced by an LLM agent.

BingX/CCXT documentation was also checked for market discovery and derivative data capabilities. The live market list remains authoritative; the project does not invent unsupported symbols.

## Final Deep Scanner hardening

The final version follows the same separation pattern used by mature open-source trading frameworks: market data is accessed through a stable provider boundary, strategy/analysis consumes that data, and execution remains outside the scanner. The implementation does not introduce a new execution path.

Specific hardening:
- Optional `RADAR_SYMBOLS` is a filter, never a mandatory source.
- Dynamic Universe remains the default source.
- Market discovery can be injected in tests without changing production behavior.
- Scanner status distinguishes `NO_OPPORTUNITY`, `DATA_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_FAILURE`, `DEGRADED`, and `HEALTHY`.
- Existing watchlist is preserved across transient discovery/provider failure.
- Test module isolation is deterministic and independent of import order.

Public engineering references reviewed before finalization include Freqtrade's DataProvider/strategy separation and Hummingbot's MarketDataProvider/controller/executor separation, plus CCXT's current guidance on reusable exchange instances, timeouts, and rate limiting.

## Runtime boundary

Offline tests cannot prove that a specific BingX account, region, instrument, margin mode, or current market list will accept a live order. The package therefore starts in PAPER mode and requires an explicit live configuration. The final live validation must be performed against the user's actual connected environment.
